# EL-2692 Semantic Release PoC - Demo Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ How to Demonstrate the Semantic Release PoC

This guide provides the exact commands to run and their expected outputs to demonstrate that the semantic-release PoC is working correctly.

---

## Prerequisites

Ensure you're on the spike branch:
```bash
git checkout spike/EL-2692-semantic-release
```

---

## Demo 1: Validate Semantic Release Configuration

The first and most important demonstration is proving that our semantic-release configuration is valid and all plugins are working correctly. This command runs semantic-release in "dry-run" mode, which means it will analyze our setup and commits without actually creating any releases or making changes to the repository.

### Command:
```bash
yarn semantic-release --dry-run
```

### Expected Output:
```
[timestamp] [semantic-release] â€º â„¹  Running semantic-release version 24.2.9
[timestamp] [semantic-release] â€º âœ”  Loaded plugin "verifyConditions" from "@semantic-release/changelog"
[timestamp] [semantic-release] â€º âœ”  Loaded plugin "verifyConditions" from "@semantic-release/npm"
[timestamp] [semantic-release] â€º âœ”  Loaded plugin "verifyConditions" from "@semantic-release/github"
[timestamp] [semantic-release] â€º âœ”  Loaded plugin "verifyConditions" from "@semantic-release/git"
[timestamp] [semantic-release] â€º âœ”  Loaded plugin "analyzeCommits" from "@semantic-release/commit-analyzer"
[timestamp] [semantic-release] â€º âœ”  Loaded plugin "generateNotes" from "@semantic-release/release-notes-generator"
[timestamp] [semantic-release] â€º âœ”  Loaded plugin "prepare" from "@semantic-release/changelog"
[timestamp] [semantic-release] â€º âœ”  Loaded plugin "prepare" from "@semantic-release/npm"
[timestamp] [semantic-release] â€º âœ”  Loaded plugin "prepare" from "@semantic-release/git"
[timestamp] [semantic-release] â€º âœ”  Loaded plugin "publish" from "@semantic-release/npm"
[timestamp] [semantic-release] â€º âœ”  Loaded plugin "publish" from "@semantic-release/github"
[timestamp] [semantic-release] â€º âœ”  Loaded plugin "addChannel" from "@semantic-release/npm"
[timestamp] [semantic-release] â€º âœ”  Loaded plugin "addChannel" from "@semantic-release/github"
[timestamp] [semantic-release] â€º âœ”  Loaded plugin "success" from "@semantic-release/github"
[timestamp] [semantic-release] â€º âœ”  Loaded plugin "fail" from "@semantic-release/github"
[timestamp] [semantic-release] â€º â„¹  This test run was triggered on the branch spike/EL-2692-semantic-release, while semantic-release is configured to only publish from main, therefore a new version won't be published.
```

### âœ… What This Proves:
- **Configuration Valid**: All plugins load successfully
- **Safety Mechanism**: Won't publish from feature branches
- **Ready for Production**: semantic-release is properly configured

---

## Demo 2: Show Version Detection Logic

Now that we've confirmed semantic-release is configured correctly, let's demonstrate the version detection logic that powers our Docker image tagging. This is the same logic that our GitHub Actions workflow uses to determine what version to tag Docker images with. Since we haven't created any semantic version tags yet, this will show our fallback mechanism in action.

### Command:
```bash
VERSION=$(git describe --tags --match="v*" --abbrev=0 2>/dev/null || echo "v0.1.0")
echo "Detected version: $VERSION"
```

### Expected Output:
```
Detected version: v0.1.0
```

### âœ… What This Proves:
- **Fallback Logic**: Defaults to v0.1.0 when no semantic version tags exist
- **Docker Integration**: This version would be used for Docker image tagging
- **First Release Ready**: When merged to main, first release will be v1.0.0

---

## Demo 3: Show Semantic Release Script Added

This demonstration shows that semantic-release has been properly integrated into the project's package.json file. Adding the script makes it easy for developers to run semantic-release locally for testing, and it's also what our GitHub Actions workflow calls to perform automated releases.

### Command:
```bash
grep -A 3 -B 3 "semantic-release" package.json | head -10
```

### Expected Output:
```json
    "test:unit": "mocha",
    "test:e2e": "yarn playwright test --config=playwright.config.ts",
    "semantic-release": "semantic-release"
  },
```

### âœ… What This Proves:
- **Script Available**: `yarn semantic-release` command is ready
- **Package Integration**: semantic-release is properly integrated into project

---

## Demo 4: Show Docker Workflow Integration

This is where the semantic versioning really shines - integration with our Docker build pipeline. Instead of tagging Docker images with cryptic commit hashes like `a1b2c3d4`, we now tag them with meaningful semantic versions like `v1.2.3`. This makes it much easier for downstream consumers (like MCC) to understand what they're deploying and make informed upgrade decisions.

Let's examine how we've modified the existing deployment workflow to detect and use semantic versions:

### Command:
```bash
grep -A 15 "get-version:" .github/workflows/deploy.yml
```

### Expected Output:
```yaml
  get-version:
    name: Get Version
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      version: ${{ steps.version.outputs.version }}
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      
      - name: Get version
        id: version
        run: |
          # Get latest tag or default to v0.1.0
          VERSION=$(git describe --tags --match="v*" --abbrev=0 2>/dev/null || echo "v0.1.0")
```

### Command:
```bash
grep -A 5 -B 5 "needs.*get-version" .github/workflows/deploy.yml
```

### Expected Output:
```yaml
  build-image:
    name: Build Docker Image
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: [get-version]
    permissions:
      id-token: write
      contents: read
```

### Command:
```bash
grep -A 5 -B 2 "needs.get-version.outputs.version" .github/workflows/deploy.yml
```

### Expected Output:
```yaml
      - name: Build and push image with semantic version
        uses: ./.github/actions/build_and_push
        with:
          image_registry: ${{ secrets.ECR_REGISTRY_URL }}
          image_repo: ${{ vars.ECR_REPOSITORY }}
          dockerfile_path: Dockerfile
          image_tag: ${{ needs.get-version.outputs.version }}
```

### âœ… What This Proves:
- **Version Job Added**: New `get-version` job detects semantic versions
- **Build Integration**: Docker build depends on version detection
- **Semantic Tagging**: Images tagged with `v1.2.3` instead of commit SHA

---

## Demo 5: Show Release Workflow Created

The heart of our semantic versioning system is the new GitHub Actions workflow that automatically analyzes commits and creates releases. This workflow runs every time code is pushed to the main branch, examining commit messages to determine what type of version bump is needed, then automatically creates GitHub releases, updates changelogs, and tags the repository.

### Command:
```bash
cat .github/workflows/release.yml
```

### Expected Output:
```yaml
name: Semantic Release

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  release:
    name: Create Release
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write
      issues: write
      pull-requests: write
      
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '24.2.0'

      - name: Enable Corepack
        run: corepack enable

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: yarn install --immutable

      - name: Run semantic-release
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        run: yarn semantic-release
```

### âœ… What This Proves:
- **Automated Releases**: Triggers on push to main branch
- **Proper Permissions**: Has write access for creating releases and tags
- **Manual Trigger**: Can be triggered manually via workflow_dispatch
- **Correct Environment**: Uses Node.js 24.2.0 and Yarn with corepack

---

## Demo 6: Show Configuration File

The `.releaserc.json` file is the brain of our semantic-release setup. It defines which plugins to use and in what order, creating a complete pipeline from commit analysis to release publication. Each plugin has a specific role: analyzing commits, generating release notes, updating changelogs, creating GitHub releases, and committing changes back to the repository.

### Command:
```bash
cat .releaserc.json
```

### Expected Output:
```json
{
  "branches": ["main"],
  "plugins": [
    "@semantic-release/commit-analyzer",
    "@semantic-release/release-notes-generator",
    "@semantic-release/changelog",
    "@semantic-release/npm",
    "@semantic-release/github",
    [
      "@semantic-release/git",
      {
        "assets": ["CHANGELOG.md", "package.json"],
        "message": "chore(release): ${nextRelease.version} [skip ci]\n\n${nextRelease.notes}"
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```

### âœ… What This Proves:
- **Complete Pipeline**: Analyzes commits â†’ generates notes â†’ creates releases
- **Changelog Automation**: Will create and update CHANGELOG.md
- **Version Management**: Updates package.json with new versions
- **GitHub Integration**: Creates GitHub releases automatically

---

## Demo 7: Show Dependencies Added

To implement semantic versioning, we've added several well-maintained, industry-standard packages to our development dependencies. These are the same tools used by major open-source projects and enterprises worldwide. The dependencies are marked as dev dependencies, so they won't affect the runtime performance or size of applications built from this template.

### Command:
```bash
grep -A 10 -B 2 "semantic-release" package.json
```

### Expected Output:
```json
  "devDependencies": {
    "semantic-release": "^22.0.5",
    "@semantic-release/changelog": "^6.0.3",
    "@semantic-release/git": "^10.0.1",
    // ... other dependencies
  }
```

### âœ… What This Proves:
- **Production Dependencies**: semantic-release and plugins installed
- **Dev Dependencies**: Won't affect production runtime
- **Latest Versions**: Using current stable versions

---

## Demo 8: Show What Happens on Different Commit Types

One of the most powerful aspects of semantic versioning is how it automatically determines the appropriate version bump based on commit message conventions. This means developers can communicate the impact of their changes through their commit messages, and the system automatically creates the right version number. Let's look at our current commit and understand how different commit types would affect versioning.

### Command:
```bash
echo "=== Current Commit ==="
git log --oneline -1

echo -e "\n=== Commit Analysis ==="
echo "Current commit: 'spike(EL-2692): semantic-release PoC implementation'"
echo "This demonstrates:"
echo "  - feat: commits â†’ Minor version bump (v1.0.0 â†’ v1.1.0)"
echo "  - fix: commits  â†’ Patch version bump (v1.0.0 â†’ v1.0.1)"  
echo "  - feat!: commits â†’ Major version bump (v1.0.0 â†’ v2.0.0)"
echo "  - spike: commits â†’ No release (development only)"
```

### Expected Output:
```
=== Current Commit ===
b665901 spike(EL-2692): semantic-release PoC implementation

=== Commit Analysis ===
Current commit: 'spike(EL-2692): semantic-release PoC implementation'
This demonstrates:
  - feat: commits â†’ Minor version bump (v1.0.0 â†’ v1.1.0)
  - fix: commits  â†’ Patch version bump (v1.0.0 â†’ v1.0.1)  
  - feat!: commits â†’ Major version bump (v1.0.0 â†’ v2.0.0)
  - spike: commits â†’ No release (development only)
```

## Demo 9: Show Before/After Comparison

To fully appreciate the value of this PoC, it's important to understand the transformation from our current state to what we'll achieve with semantic versioning. This comparison highlights the concrete benefits for both the ETT maintainers and downstream consumers like the MCC team.

### Command:
```bash
echo "=== BEFORE PoC ==="
echo "Docker images tagged with: commit-sha (e.g., a1b2c3d4)"
echo "No automated releases"
echo "No version history"
echo "MCC must reference 'main' branch (unpredictable)"
echo ""
echo "=== AFTER PoC ==="
echo "Docker images tagged with: semantic-version (e.g., v1.2.3)"
echo "Automated GitHub releases on every main push"
echo "Auto-generated CHANGELOG.md"
echo "MCC can pin to specific versions (e.g., ett@v1.2.0)"
```

### Expected Output:
```
=== BEFORE PoC ===
Docker images tagged with: commit-sha (e.g., a1b2c3d4)
No automated releases
No version history
MCC must reference 'main' branch (unpredictable)

=== AFTER PoC ===
Docker images tagged with: semantic-version (e.g., v1.2.3)
Automated GitHub releases on every main push
Auto-generated CHANGELOG.md
MCC can pin to specific versions (e.g., ett@v1.2.0)
```
